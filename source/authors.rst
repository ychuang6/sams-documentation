The semi-automatic mandible segmentation (SAMS) pipeline was developed as a tool to aid in the goal of quantifying the multidimensional growth of the human mandible during the course of development. This project started in the `Vocal Tract Development Lab <http://www.waisman.wisc.edu/vocal>`_, Waisman Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2013 under the supervision of VTLab Director and Principal Investigator `Dr. Houri K. Vorperian <http://www.waisman.wisc.edu/pi-Vorperian-Houri.htm>`_ and with guidance from co-investigator `Dr. Moo K. Chung <http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~mchung>`_.

The development of this pipeline is a culmination of efforts of the following VTLab team members who worked on this project in chronological order: `Dr. Nagesh Adluru <http://brainimaging.waisman.wisc.edu/~adluru>`_, Simon Lank, Benjamin M. Doherty and Ying Ji Chuang. The refinement of this pipeline and development of this documentation are the direct outcomes of Ying Ji Chuang's effort, with valuable guidance and input from Dr. Nagesh Adluru.
